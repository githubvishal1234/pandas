When attempting to write to parquet, this fails with the following error:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\npyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: (\"Could not convert <StringArray>\\\\n[\\'foo\\', \\'bar\\', <NA>]\\\\nLength: 3, dtype: string with type StringArray: did not recognize Python value type when inferring an Arrow data type\", \\'Conversion failed for column project with type object\\')\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m not sure why this is happening, because `StringArray` clearly implements the `__arrow_array__` [protocol](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/extending_types.html) that should be allowing this conversion. This also happens if the string is of type `\"string[pyarrow]\"`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe workaround I\\'ve been using so far is to re-type the column as `object` prior to the `groupby`. This results in values of type `np.ndarray`, which are parquet-able. But this is suboptimal because we use `read_parquet` upstream that types the column as `\"string\"`, which means that we have to remember to retype it every time we do this aggregation, else it will fail downstream when writing to parquet. It seems like this should work with the column typed as `\"string\"`.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Expected Behavior\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should successfully write the parquet file without failures.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Installed Versions\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : bdc79c146c2e32f2cab629be240f01658cfb6cc2\\r\\npython                : 3.9.17.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Darwin\\r\\nOS-release            : 23.3.0\\r\\nVersion               : Darwin Kernel Version 23.3.0: Wed Dec 20 21:30:44 PST 2023; root:xnu-10002.81.5~7/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000\\r\\nmachine               : arm64\\r\\nprocessor             : arm\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.1\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\r\\nsetuptools            : 58.1.0\\r\\npip                   : 23.0.1\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : None\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : None\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : None\\r\\nIPython               : 8.18.1\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : None\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : None\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : None\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : 15.0.0\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : None\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",

       "  'body': \"### Pandas version checks\\r\\n\\r\\n- [X] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\\r\\n\\r\\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest version](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/index.html) of pandas.\\r\\n\\r\\n- [ ] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [main branch](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/getting_started/install.html#installing-the-development-version-of-pandas) of pandas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Reproducible Example\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nimport pandas \\r\\nimport numpy as np \\r\\np = np.array([\\r\\n              [1,2,3], \\r\\n              [1,2,3]\\r\\n             ])\\r\\n\\r\\ndf = pandas.DataFrame(columns=['n', 'p'])\\r\\ndf['n'] = np.array([0,0])\\r\\ndf['p'] = p \\r\\n\\r\\nprint(df)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n   n  p\\r\\n0  0  1\\r\\n1  0  1\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Issue Description\\r\\n\\r\\nPassing the columns as separate arrays, but one of the arrays has the wrong dimensions Nx2 instead of Nx1. In that case, the dataframe column 'p' can be assigned that Nx2 array, but only the first column of the array is actually assigned to 'p'. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile this is hard to happen by accident, it's not impossible. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Expected Behavior\\r\\n\\r\\nEither store each row of the array to the corresponding row of the dataframe or raise a warning/error for trying to store a NxM array as a column. \\r\\n\\r\\nSee for example: \\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nimport pandas \\r\\nimport numpy as np \\r\\n\\r\\np =          [\\r\\n              [1,2], \\r\\n              [1,2]\\r\\n             ]\\r\\n\\r\\ndf = pandas.DataFrame(columns=['n', 'p'])\\r\\ndf['n'] = [0,0]\\r\\ndf['p'] = p \\r\\n\\r\\nprint(df)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n   n       p\\r\\n0  0  [1, 2]\\r\\n1  0  [1, 2]\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Installed Versions\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : bdc79c146c2e32f2cab629be240f01658cfb6cc2\\r\\npython                : 3.10.12.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Linux\\r\\nOS-release            : 6.1.58+\\r\\nVersion               : #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Sat Nov 18 15:31:17 UTC 2023\\r\\nmachine               : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor             : x86_64\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.1\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.25.2\\r\\npytz                  : 2023.4\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 67.7.2\\r\\npip                   : 23.1.2\\r\\nCython                : 3.0.8\\r\\npytest                : 7.4.4\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : 5.0.2\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : 4.9.4\\r\\nhtml5lib              : 1.1\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : 2.9.9\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.3\\r\\nIPython               : 7.34.0\\r\\npandas_datareader     : 0.10.0\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : 2023.6.0\\r\\ngcsfs                 : 2023.6.0\\r\\nmatplotlib            : 3.7.1\\r\\nnumba                 : 0.58.1\\r\\nnumexpr               : 2.9.0\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.2\\r\\npandas_gbq            : 0.19.2\\r\\npyarrow               : 14.0.2\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.11.4\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.28\\r\\ntables                : 3.8.0\\r\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\r\\nxarray                : 2023.7.0\\r\\nxlrd                  : 2.0.1\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\",\n",
